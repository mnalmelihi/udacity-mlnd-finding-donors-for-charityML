# Finding Donors for CharityML
This was the first project in the Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program from Udacity. In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then I will choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.7.7 -  *Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, time, and IPython*.

## Data
The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
